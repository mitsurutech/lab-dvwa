# DVWA lab with Docker Compose: practise SQL injection, XSS and web security on the Damn Vulnerable Web Application

[![check](https://github.com/mitsurutech/lab-dvwa/actions/workflows/check.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mitsurutech/lab-dvwa/actions/workflows/check.yml)

A ready-made **web application security lab** for classrooms, from the [MitsuruTech Learning Platform](https://mitsurutech.co.uk/learning), where schools and colleges give every student their own databases, containers and terminal in the browser. Each student gets their own copy of **DVWA, the Damn Vulnerable Web Application**, with its database already made, to practise **SQL injection, cross-site scripting, command injection** and more one weakness at a time, at four security levels that show what each fix changes. They explain the flaw, and hand in evidence, with nothing installed and no risk to anybody else's machine.

It is one `docker-compose` file, `compose.yaml`, and it runs the same on your own machine as it does on the platform, where every student gets a private copy with no way out to the internet.

## The one rule

**Attack your own copy and nothing else.** Everything in this lab runs inside your own private copy, which has no route to the internet and none to any other student, so the only thing you can reach is the application the lab started for you. Never point a tool at a website, a network or a machine you do not own, in a lab or anywhere else: in the UK that is an offence under the [Computer Misuse Act 1990](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1990/18/contents), and most countries have a law like it. Learning how weaknesses work is how you build software that does not have them, and a good first conversation in a class is why this rule exists and what responsible disclosure looks like.

## What is in it

| Service | Image | Memory | What it is |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `dvwa` | [`ghcr.io/digininja/dvwa`](https://github.com/digininja/DVWA) pinned by digest | 512 MB | Apache and PHP running DVWA |
| `db` | [`mariadb:11.4`](https://hub.docker.com/_/mariadb) | 384 MB | the database DVWA stores its users and exercises in |

DVWA publishes only `latest` and a tag per commit, so it is pinned by its image digest, `sha256:1af2cedd...11b0` (the full value is in `compose.yaml`). It starts in about seven seconds and uses roughly 130 MB when lightly used. The database is created for you: the lab presses the setup page's **Create / Reset Database** once the server answers, and only then reports itself ready, so "ready" means you can sign in.

The images are third-party programs, run unmodified from the projects' own public images and pinned to a version (never `latest`), so the lab does not change under a class between one lesson and the next. Nothing is built here and nothing from this repository is distributed in them.

## Using it on the platform

The [MitsuruTech Learning Platform](https://mitsurutech.co.uk/learning) gives every student their own copy of a lab, in the browser, with a terminal beside it.

**To try it:** open the [container page](https://mitsurutech.co.uk/container), find this lab in **Sample labs** and press Start. No account is needed to try one.

**To set it as work for a class:**

1. In your module, make a task of type **Lab** and choose **In a GitHub repository**.
2. Give `https://github.com/mitsurutech/lab-dvwa` with the branch `main`. The compose file is the default, `compose.yaml`. Fork the repository first if you want to change the file.
3. Publish. Every student's copy starts from the commit you published, so a later change here does not alter a lab already set.
4. Say in the task what to hand in (see [For teachers](#for-teachers)), and assign it like any other task.

The help manual's [guide to the security labs](https://mitsurutech.co.uk/help/security-labs) and its [guide to container labs](https://mitsurutech.co.uk/help/labs) cover the rest: what a compose file may say, how much memory a copy gets, and how a teacher opens, watches and marks a student's copy.

## Running it on your own machine

You need Docker with the Compose plugin. The first start downloads the images.

```bash
docker compose -f compose.yaml -f local.yaml up
```

{c["local_open"]}

`local.yaml` publishes the ports on `127.0.0.1` only, so the lab is reachable from your own computer and from nowhere else. Stop it with `Ctrl-C`, and remove it with `docker compose -f compose.yaml -f local.yaml down -v`. Run it on a machine you are happy to attack from: the application is insecure on purpose.

## Working through it

## For teachers

Nothing in this lab is marked automatically. The student hands in evidence and you mark it, the way you mark any other lab.

**Ask for evidence in two halves.** First, proof of the work: {c["proof"]}, with the lab's own address visible in the browser so it is clearly their copy. Second, the understanding: for each one, a written explanation in their own words of what the weakness is, the exact input they used and why it worked, what an attacker could do with it, and how the code should have been written. The second half tells you whether it was understood or copied from a walkthrough. For stronger work ask for the fix as well as the attack.

**Where it sits in a course.** {c["course"]} Check your own awarding body's unit for the exact wording; none is quoted here.

**Who sees what.** These labs are often used with students aged 16 and 17. A copy is private to the student who started it. A member of staff who teaches the module can open it to see what the student has done, and opening a student's work is written to the access log, which the student can read.

## Checking the lab

`test/check.sh` starts the lab the way the platform's runner starts every service (all capabilities dropped, `no-new-privileges`, a process limit, memory limits, and no way out to the internet) and then checks from inside its network what this page promises. It needs Docker and runs on every push, which is the badge at the top.

```bash
test/check.sh
```
